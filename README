Simple chrome extension that gives the IP address of the server being connected to, similar to ShowIP for Firefox. A difference from ShowIP is that Chrome does not leave enough room to automatically show the full IP address. For this reason just the last segment is shown automatically but the full IP address is available by clicking on the icon.

An alternative to showing the last segment of the IP address is to show a three letter mnemonic instead. See options to assign mnemonics.

Outstanding bugs
----------------
After loading a tab, switch to another tab and load a different site. Quickly return to the first tab. When the second tab finishes loading it changes the badge even though the current tab's IP address is different.

Outstanding improvements
------------------------
Add function to auto-remove all URL, IP pair that don't correspond to an open tab once localStorage is full (rare, impossible?).
Figure out how to load configuration variables (mnems and sips) when changed rather than when used.
Add wild cards, at least * (star - all), to the IP addresses on the mnemonic options.
Add full size icon for use in Chrome 'store', extension listing, etc.
